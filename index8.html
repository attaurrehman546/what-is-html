	Using bullet points or creating lists is not always necessary in every situation, but their primary purpose is to help organize your data in a clear and structured way. Lists make information easier to scan and understand quickly, which is especially useful when presenting multiple related items. For instance, if you are making a shopping list, using a list format is crucial because it allows you to clearly see and keep track of the items you need to buy without confusion. Lists come in two main types: ordered and unordered. In HTML, when you create an unordered list, the items are displayed with bullet points, which are simple dots or other symbols that help visually separate each entry. On the other hand, when you create an ordered list, the items are shown in a numbered sequence, which is useful for steps or instructions that need to follow a particular order. Using these list types appropriately helps improve the readability and organization of your content, making it more user-friendly and visually appealing. For example:
