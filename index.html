	HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is like the skeleton of a website â€” it gives structure to everything you see on the internet! Think of it as the recipe that tells your browser how to arrange text, images, headings, and links on a page. Without HTML, websites would be a jumbled mess of words and pictures.

Its super easy to learn and is the first step if you want to build your own website or just understand how the web works. Using simple tags like h1 for big titles or p for paragraphs, you tell the browser what each piece of content is.

Plus, HTML keeps evolving, adding cool new features that make websites more interactive and fun. So if you're curious about creating your own online space, HTML is your bestfriend to start with!

Me personaly am still learing about html. My name is <strong> Atta ur rehman</strong>. I've leared things I didn't know you could do with html. Like the fact that you can create a "try for yourself" in which you can show what the code looks like. And in advance HTML you can create a place where people can ask the user to input your code and see what it will look like
